# Ray Tracing Cuda

This repo contains my solution to the Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley. Read more about it here <http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html>

Furthermore the repo contains the CUDA extensions specified by this blog by Roger Allen at NVidia <https://devblogs.nvidia.com/accelerated-ray-tracing-cuda/>

Lastly it is planned to contain a ML model for filling in the missing rays of the path tracer - lets see if we get there.
